# Search OmniFocus Alfred Workflow

## What is this?

This is a workflow for [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/) that performs free text searches on [OmniFocus](http://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus) data.

## Why would I want such a thing?

Well, I want it because I can't quickly search for, say, a task within OmniFocus using OmniFocus' search field. OmniFocus restricts search results to the current perspective or selection. [Other people have noticed this too](https://discourse.omnigroup.com/t/how-to-search-all-content-a-via-changed-perspective/366).

## How to install

[Download the `.workflow` file from the Releases page](https://github.com/rhydlewis/search-omnifocus/releases/).

## How to use

## Note

This workflow only works with OmniFocus 3.

### Searching for tasks

* Search for all tasks within OmniFocus (irrespective of status) with `.s`:

## Thanks to...

* [Dean Jackson](https://github.com/deanishe): the [Python library for Alfred workflows](https://github.com/deanishe/alfred-workflow) does most of the heavy lifting. Excellent stuff, thank you.
* [Marko Kaestner](https://github.com/markokaestner): I used the [in-depth workflow](https://github.com/markokaestner/of-task-actions) to provide some insight into how to search Omnifocus.
* [Danny Smith](https://github.com/dannysmith): for providing a new, and quite frankly, much improved workflow icon.
